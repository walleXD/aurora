# Aurora

## Manage hostfiles from the cli

### Motivation

Control over hostfiles is a very common task. Currently most of the cli apps feel cumbersome. There are many GUI experiences for managing hostfiles but they often feel too clunky.

Inspired by `sheldon`, which is a zsh plugin manager, `aurora` provides a simple interface to manage hostfiles like plugins.
